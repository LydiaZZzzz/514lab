To ensure my ESP32 and Ultrasonic Sensor runs for 24 hours on a 500mAh battery. The ultrasonic sensor measures distance every 3 seconds, and only uploads data to Firebase if movement is detected 3 times consecutively. If no movement is detected for 30 seconds, the device enters deep sleep for 30 seconds. Upon waking, it performs 3 consecutive measurementsâ€”if no movement is detected, it returns to sleep. WiFi is turned on only when needed and fully disabled afterward, significantly reducing power consumption.
